# EXPLANATION OF require_relative:
# require_relative is used to load the state data file into our file. Shortcut for require 
# requre give the whole path.

#What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
# hash is created by using its implicit form and Each named key is a symbol 

#What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
#Require_relative is used to load a file and its shortcut form of require, where in require_relative you don't need to give full_Path of the file when 
#its in same directory

#What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
# Using block to go through each hash key and value using (each do ...code... end ) and also can be used manually hash_name[:key]=value.


#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
# That they are instance variables and can be called any where within the class, so i have called (@state) directly and two other variables with the methods.

#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
# I can say iteration through hash in hash.
