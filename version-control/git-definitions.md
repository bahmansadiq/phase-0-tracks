# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.


* What is version control?

Version control software allows you to track the changes you make to your code,
 as well as being able to easily backtrack these changes, share your development efforts and more



*  Why is it useful?

Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on
 long-lived (or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

branch is getting a copy of master to work on in a project.
While working on a project different ideas might be working in different stages, some are ready to go some are still pending branching helps you to manage this
work flow.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

commit is used to stage and leave message on each changes brought to the project, all the changes can be traced using it's history.
A good commit message should be specific, short and meaningful.


* What is a merge conflict?
When two people changed the same lines in that same file, or if one person decided to delete it while the other person decided to modify it, 
Git simply cannot know what is correct.
 Git will then mark the file as having a conflict - which you'll have to solve it your own.
